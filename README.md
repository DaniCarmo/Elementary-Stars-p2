# Features

## Existing features

### Navigation Bar

- Featured on the game.html page to return Home, as well as the three levels pages to either return Home or go back to the game page to chose a level, the fully responsive navigation bar includes two links. It is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
- This will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
  
### Home Page Logo

- The landing includes the quiz name "Kindergarten Stars" with a logo picture of an open book with pop up features.
- This section introduces the user to Kindergraten Stars with fun colors and a child friendly vibe and cartton pictures, that follows across the site.
  
### Username Input

- This username form will allow the players to enter a username which will be tracked by the site and linked to their highscore, to provide a better user experience as the user can keep record of their highscore each time they play or log back in to the quiz.
- This form also uses javascript form validation to ensure the player enters a username before they can carry on with the quiz.
  
### Levels Page

- This page allows the user to chose a level and the levels have kid-friendly names so they can be identified by a child as to how easy or hard they are, level one being the easiest "Easy-peasy", level two "Smarty Pants" is for confident players, and finally level three is for advanced players "Quiz Master".
- The level buttons are large and color coded to help a child chose a level easily and upon return they will be able to recognice each level by the color.
- The page also has an image of a smiling cartoon star to reflect the name of the quiz "Elementary Stars" and provides a light and fun spirit that is also easy on the eye for the user.

# Design of Website

## Wireframes

### Home Page

### Game Page - Chose a Level

### Levels 1-3

## Fonts

The fonts for the site came from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com)

The name and headings are Permanent Marker, while the smaller body text is Ysabeau Infant.

Permanent Marker offers an informal touch to the site and the rounded edges give a playful feel to the whole site. Ysabeau Infant pairs well with Permanent Marker as both have the rounded edges and informal style, while Ysabeau works well with the smaller text and is very easy to read.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme is based around a sunset, bringing in purple, red and peachy-pinks creates that sunset beach vibes that are being conveyed to the user. The colors provide a fun yet and serene viewing experience. The color scheme is by choice minimalist with the same colors used throughout the website, in keeping with the overall mood of a beach sunset. The background is a neutral white which in contrast to the soft red and pinks, provides a fresh and modern aspect to the website.

The main color used throughout is #F88379 and the background color for the aside was also inspired by the hero image, taking the deeper purple colors I went with #705260.

## Images

All images were downloaded from Pexel. The main image used for the homepage banner, gallery and timetable backgrounds is a serene pink and purple hue picture of a sky mirrored in still water below.

The Gallery page also has images from Pexel that show people practicing yoga and meditation on the beach, both solo and in groups, as well as friendly get togethers on the beach with food and music, to evoke a sense of community to the user.

# Languages

The languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# Technologies used

- Wireframe.cc was used to create the wireframes
- Google Fonts was used for the fonts
- Github was used for hosting the site and storing the data and files
- Google Chrome Developer Tools were used throughout to inspect elements and assist with troubleshooting and debugging
- [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) was used to get color from the homepage image to use on the form and quiz border and text
- [Onlinecovert.com](https://www.onlineconvert.com/image-converter) to convert main large images from .jpg to .webp, as suggested by prompt after Lighthouse analysis in dev tools testing
  
# Testing

## Validation

### HTML

...

### CSS

...

## Browser Compatability

The website was tested on the following browsers and was responsive and compatible:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Egde

## Unfixed Bugs

...

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness was tested throughout the project using Chrome Developer tools and also ui.dev and responsivedesignchecker.com. All images and features were responsive in various screen sizes and quality was not affected as I was able to amend via media queries in my css file to ensure the website followed good UX design practices on all device screen sizes. Screenshots linked below as examples, site was tested on multiple view ports such as Iphone SE, Samsung Galaxy S8+, iPad Air, iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy A51/71 as well as a 24 inch monitor screen. [Link to Test Screenshots](https://github.com/DaniCarmo/South-West-Yoga-P1/tree/main/assets/testing-images)

Using Lighthouse to test responsivenes showed that the performance of the site on mobile was not ideal and the main attribute to this was the hero image being too large and not loading on time. Therefore I researched in to this issue and resolved it by firstly converting the image to a webp file and also resizing the image so a smaller image is now included in the media queries for smaller screens. I also added a preload link to the html file to preload the LCP and optimise the responsiveness of the site.

## User Stories Testing

As a first-time user I want to:

Be able to easily identify the purpose of the site. The user can identify what this site is about from the name South West Yoga as well as the home page banner which mentions mindfulness and joining the classes on the beach.

![hero-img](https://github.com/DaniCarmo/South-West-Yoga-P1/blob/main/assets/readme-images/hero-img.PNG?raw=true)

The user can also watch a quick video on the benefits of mindfulness including mediation and yoga.

Get a sense of community and welcoming from the South West Yoga group. The user can get a sense of community via the gallery page as well as the About page which has more information on the teacher and group facilitator, providing a brief background helps make that connection with the user.
